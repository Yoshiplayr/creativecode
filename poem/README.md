First, I decided to simply build upon the Frankenpoem code. I was having trouble thinking of where else to go with my project, so I decided to simply expand on what was already here. 
My main changes were to what it could search for, what it would print, and how it would look. 
I added a plethora of word types it could search for to decide what I wanted in the end, and ended up only using a few for my final outputs, but the options are still present if I wanted to change what types of words or make a different poem.
Second, my source is all the text in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. I found someone who typed it all up on Gamefaqs here:

I edited my file slightly, removing the large introduction and table of contents, and removing a large amount of the in-between text, which was mostly a bunch of underscores, hyphens, and equal signs, which python kept reading as nouns.

After figuring out that, when printing, the program would keep one randomly selected word for each variable, so I decided to use that in my end poems.
My "poems" ended up being 3 line stanzas, the first establishing 2 names and an action. The following 2 lines have each name do the action to a random noun. It's a simple format, but can be surprisingly effective.

For the most part, the resulting text is simple enough to feel like it could have deeper meaning, such as this result:
Shall and Mother keeping
Shall keeping mind
Mother keeping silent
It just... feels poetic in my eyes. While it won't always make sense, "Crown holding surprise" is an output I just got, the short sentences give it a sort of rhythm, and if the same names are chosen, maybe a story could be interpreted. It's a stretch, but it could give some inspiration for something greater.
For me personally, I can see something as a poem if it repeats a specific format several times, be it line length, syllables, or words. 

My main issue is sometimes some other words will be misinterpreted as proper nouns, "dont", scenario names like "DB06" and a handful of verbs are the main culprit. However, with a game like Skyrim, there are so many fake names they don't sound so out of place next to "tinvak" and "Ysgramor".

My favorite outputs I got were:
Brynjolf and Guardian arguing
Brynjolf arguing loyalty
Guardian arguing soul

Skyrim and Dragonborn keeping
Skyrim keeping Balgruuf
Dragonborn keeping help

Falkreath and Cyrodiil cracking
Falkreath cracking Tullius
Cyrodiil cracking course

Elenwen and Guard meting
Elenwen meting player
Guard meting Enthir
