For my screensaver I wanted to do something a bit more chaotic, like the classic pipes.
Once I learned you could upload images, I uploaded one of Teddie, the mascot of Persona 4 as a test.
I then decided to put his location in as random(),random(), which led to him just violently shaking, and when a classmate suggested I multiply the random() value by something, I saw it made him shake around the screen in larger movements. When the value was along the lines of 5000 * random(), he essentially teleported around the screen. 
Additionally, when you showed us how the images could leave a trail while they moved, potentially leaving one that would stay for a long time, I decided I wanted to incorporate that into the project.
When you showed us how to do the bouncing ball example, I decided to add that to another Persona mascot character, this time the cat Morgana from Persona 5. I later edited the parameters of the bouncing to be exactly the edges of the screen.
So at this point, I had the 2 out of 3 mascots, and I wanted to incorporate the last, Koromaru the dog from Persona 3, so I decided to have a line of Koromarus bouncing up and down the screen. I ended up toning it down, having the space of one dog in between each because they were covering up all the residue from the cat and bear.

In the end, I had the chaotic screensaver I wanted, with these mascots flying around the screen, but still pleasant to look at to a degree. I was tempted to make it just the bear, because that effect was my favorite, but I liked the lines having all 3 created so I ended up keeping them all.

I also uploaded the images used in the screensaver to the github folder here.

I also quickly created a version that scales, aptly named teddiescaling.js also in the folder, though it doesn't work as well due to the one with specific parameters being built specifically for a screen of that size
