# Smash Matchups

My bot, Smash Matchups, was born from the need to have fresh smash matchups when my roommate and I played Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. 
Obviously, the characters were a necessity, as they are the meat of the game, but to get more options, I added stages, and then added rulesets to make the number a bit bigger and give more directive when taking matches from the bot.
As I worked on the code and looked at what it tweeted, I thought it looked bland, and looked into adding images. I was able to figure out how, and added the official render straight from smashbros.com for a majority of the characters, using other websites if the available render wasn't a recognizable color pallete. I was tempted to add images for the stage, but I liked how it looked with the 2 fighters opposite of each other.

In the end, the number of options ended up:
Gamemode - 3
Fighter - 80 
Stage - 105
Stage morph - 106
Rule - 7
Rule2 - 2
Calculations: Gamemode x Fighter x Fighter x Stage x Stage morph x Rule x Rule2
Calculations:     3    x    80   x   80    x  105  x     106     x  7   x   2
Final number: 2,991,744,000

I'll be updating the bot as fighters and stages are added, so the final number, once the last 3 fighters and stages are added, will be:
3,406,086,936
